🧠 MedicaAI - Virtual AI Health Assistant
Your AI Health Companion - A web-based application that uses Machine Learning and Flask to predict diseases based on user input symptoms.

It provides the disease description, related symptoms, and precautionary measures to take. The assistant acts like a chatbot that interacts with users in real-time through a clean web interface.

🚀 Features
✅ Predict diseases using a pre-trained Random Forest model
🧠 Respond like a chatbot through the frontend interface
📊 Displays disease description, symptoms, and precautions
🔍 Fuzzy symptom matching - automatically corrects misspelled symptoms
📈 Confidence scoring with alternative diagnoses
⚖️ Symptom severity analysis (1-7 scale)
🌐 Fully functional Flask backend with RESTful API
💬 Easy to customize and expand for more features
🧰 Tech Stack
Component	Technology Used
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend	Python, Flask
Machine Learning	scikit-learn, Random Forest
Data Processing	pandas, NumPy

🛠️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone or Download
git clone https://github.com/your-username/medicaai.git
cd medicaai
2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate:
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
3️⃣ Install Required Packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Train the Model (Optional - pre-trained models included)
python train_model.py
This will generate updated model files in the models/ folder.

5️⃣ Run the Flask App
python app.py
The server will start at: 👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:10000

Open this URL in your browser to use the assistant.

🌐 API Endpoints
GET /
Returns the main web interface

POST /api/predict
Predicts disease based on symptoms

Request Body:

{
  "symptoms": "fever, cough, headache"
}
Response:

{
  "status": "success",
  "messages": [...],
  "raw_results": {
    "top_prediction": {
      "disease": "Common Cold",
      "probability": 0.85,
      "description": "...",
      "precautions": [...]
    },
    "alternative_predictions": [...],
    "symptom_details": [...]
  }
}
GET /api/symptoms
Returns list of all recognized symptoms

🔧 Fixing Common Issues
CSS Not Loading?
If your CSS is not loading, check your index.html inside templates/ and make sure the CSS is linked like this:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">
Do not use relative paths like static/style.css — Flask handles this through url_for.

Also, try hard refreshing the browser with Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac).

Port Already in Use?
If port 10000 is busy, you can change it:

PORT=8080 python app.py
Or modify the port in app.py:

port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080))
🧠 Model Training Details
The Random Forest classifier is trained with:

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Stratified K-Fold cross-validation (5 folds)
Class balancing to handle imbalanced disease distributions
Feature importance analysis for interpretability
Model Performance:

Training uses 80/20 train-test split
Achieves high accuracy on validation set
Supports prediction of 40+ diseases
Handles 130+ unique symptoms
💻 Command Line Usage
You can also use the predictor from command line:

# Interactive mode
python predict_disease.py --interactive

# Single prediction
python predict_disease.py --symptoms "fever, cough, fatigue"
🚀 Deployment
Deploy to Render
Push your code to GitHub
Connect your repository to Render
Render will automatically detect render.yaml
Your app will be deployed at https://your-app.onrender.com
The render.yaml file is already configured for deployment.
